\usage{
SL.hal9001(Y, X, newX = NULL, degrees = NULL, fit_type = c("origami",
  "glmnet"), n_folds = 10, use_min = TRUE, family = stats::gaussian(),
  obsWeights = rep(1, length(Y)), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A \code{numeric} of outcomes.}

\item{X}{A \code{matrix} of predictors/covariates.}

\item{newX}{A matrix of new observations on which to obtain predictions. The
default of \code{NULL} computes predictions on training inputs \code{X}.}

\item{degrees}{The highest order of interaction terms for which the basis
functions ought to be generated. The default (\code{NULL}) corresponds to
generating basis functions for the full dimensionality of the input matrix.}

\item{fit_type}{The specific routine to be called when fitting the LASSO
regression in a cross-validated manner. Choosing the \code{glmnet} option
will result in a call to \code{cv.glmnet} while \code{origami} will produce
a (faster) call to a custom routine based on the \code{origami} package.}

\item{n_folds}{Integer for the number of folds to be used when splitting the
data for cross-validation. This defaults to 10 as this is the convention for
v-fold cross-validation.}

\item{use_min}{Determines which lambda is selected from \code{cv.glmnet}.
\code{TRUE} corresponds to \code{"lambda.min"} and \code{FALSE} corresponds
to \code{"lambda.1se"}.}

\item{family}{Not used by the function directly, but ensures compatibility
with \code{SuperLearner}.}

\item{obsWeights}{Not used by the function directly, but meant to ensure
compatibility with \code{SuperLearner}.}

\item{...}{Prevents unexpected process death. DON'T USE. (This is a hack.)}
