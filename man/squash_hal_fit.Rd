\title{Squash HAL objects}
\usage{
squash_hal_fit(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{hal9001}, containing the results of
fitting the Highly Adaptive LASSO, as produced by a call to \code{fit_hal}.}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{hal9001}, similar to the input object but
reduced such that coefficients belonging to bases with coefficients equal
to zero removed.
}
\description{
Reduce footprint by dropping basis functions with coefficients of zero
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# generate simple test data
n <- 100
p <- 3
x <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)
y <- sin(x[, 1]) * sin(x[, 2]) + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.2)

# fit HAL model and squash resulting object to reduce footprint
hal_fit <- fit_hal(X = x, Y = y, yolo = FALSE)
squashed <- squash_hal_fit(hal_fit)
}
