\title{Compute Degree of Basis Functions}
\usage{
basis_of_degree(x, degree, order_map, include_zero_order)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An input \code{matrix} containing observations and covariates
following standard conventions in problems of statistical learning.}

\item{degree}{The highest order of interaction terms for which the basis
functions ought to be generated. The default (\code{NULL}) corresponds to
generating basis functions for the full dimensionality of the input matrix.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} containing  basis functions and cutoffs generated from
 a set of input columns up to a particular pre-specified degree.
}
\description{
Find the full list of basis functions up to a particular degree
}
