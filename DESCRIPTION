Description: Routines for constructing sparse matrices of basis functions, as
  well as a custom implementation of L1-regularized regression (i.e. the LASSO),
  altogether providing a fast, computationally efficient implementation of the
  Highly Adaptive LASSO (HAL), primarily in C++ but made available for use in R
  through Rcpp.
