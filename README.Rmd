## What's `hal9001`?

`hal9001` is an R package providing an implementation of the scalable _highly
adaptive lasso_ (HAL), a nonparametric regression estimator that applies
L1-regularized lasso regression to a design matrix composed of indicator
functions corresponding to the support of the functional over a set of
covariates and interactions thereof. HAL regression allows for arbitrarily
complex functional forms to be estimated at fast (near-parametric) convergence
rates under only global smoothness assumptions [@vdl2017generally;
@bibaut2019fast]. For detailed theoretical discussions of the highly adaptive
lasso estimator, consider consulting, for example, @vdl2017generally,
@vdl2017finite, and @vdl2017uniform. For a computational demonstration of the
versatility of HAL regression, see @benkeser2016hal. Recent theoretical works
have demonstrated success in building efficient estimators of complex
parameters when particular variations of HAL regression are used to estimate
nuisance parameters [e.g., @vdl2019efficient; @ertefaie2020nonparametric].

## Installation

For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hal9001) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("hal9001")
```

To contribute, install the _development version_ of `hal9001` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/hal9001")
```

## Issues

If you encounter any bugs or have any specific feature requests, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/tlverse/hal9001/issues).

## Example

Consider the following minimal example in using `hal9001` to generate
predictions via Highly Adaptive Lasso regression:

```{r example}
# load the package and set a seed
library(hal9001)
set.seed(385971)

# simulate data
n <- 100
p <- 3
x <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)
y <- x[, 1] * sin(x[, 2]) + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.2)

# fit the HAL regression
hal_fit <- fit_hal(X = x, Y = y)
hal_fit$times

# training sample prediction
preds <- predict(hal_fit, new_data = x)
mean(hal_mse <- (preds - y)^2)
```
